# Computer Vision Project

An image segmentation and classification project with CNN based architecure using Tensorflow and OpenCV.

This code provides a template for implementing an encoder-decoder image segmentation model using OpenCV and TensorFlow. It needs to be adapted to specific datasets and requirements. Additionally,  using data augmentation and more advanced architectures might be needed to improve the segmentation results.
